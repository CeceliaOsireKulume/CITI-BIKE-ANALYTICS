# NYC CITI-BIKES
Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City and Hoboken, New Jersey. Named after lead sponsor Citigroup. The bike sharing program was designed to give residents and visitors a fun, affordable and convenient alternative to walking, taxis, buses and subways. With over 1,700 Citi Bike stations and 27,000 bikes across the cities, Citi Bike is the most accessible way to get around and explore NYC.
